### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Kathryn Wilkinson**. I'm a MERN developer with an affinity for *front-end design*, skilled in *JavaScript*,  *React*, and *custom CSS*. My interest in web development started at the beginning of 2020 when the pandemic emerged. Completed a *Full Stack Web Development* bootcamp with [Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilogy_Education_Services) - now [edX](https://www.edx.org/boot-camps/about) - in 2021.

In addition to said technical skills, over the course of my career I've accumulated graphic design, adaptive communication, client needs assessment & business requirements, leadership, and creative problem solving savvy via my background as a teacher, artist, musician, social worker, and high-volume bartender.

**Currently**, I'm employed as a *web development instructor* at [Generation USA](https://www.generation.org/) where I've been teaching: 

>- Agile software development
>- Command Line
>- git + GitHub
>- HTML 
>- CSS
>- JavaScript
>- Node 
>- Unit Testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), as well as with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)

I've also recently been coordinating the development, editing, and implementation of a reusable curriculum for the JWD and JFS Programs, including the development of coding problems, projects, & solutions for program participants.

My goals when working a project are to capture an aesthetic and develop a seamless user experience. I also have a passion for developing effective communication with both my team and individuals.

Actively looking for a full-time developer role.
