### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Kathryn Wilkinson**. I'm a full-stack web developer with technical skills in *JavaScript* & *React*, and an affinity for *front-end development*. My interest in web development started at the beginning of 2020 when the pandemic emerged. I then completed a *MERN Stack* bootcamp with [Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilogy_Education_Services) - now [edX](https://www.edx.org/boot-camps/about) - in 2021.

Other skills accumulated in graphic design, adaptive communication, client needs assessment, leadership, and creative problem solving, are attributed to my dynamic, unconventional history as a teacher, artist, musician, social worker, and high-volume bartender.

**Currently**, I'm employed as a *web development instructor* at [Generation USA](https://www.generation.org/) where I've also been coordinating the development, editing, and implementation of a reusable curriculum for the JWD and JFS Programs.

>Take a look at some of the program repositories I've created and contributed to!

>- [JWD National Flex 04]()

And with my own projects, I've been focused on building human-centered products, and beautiful, responsive web experiences for them.
