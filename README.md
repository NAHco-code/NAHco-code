### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Kathryn Wilkinson**. I'm a full-stack web developer with an affinity for *front-end development*, skilled in *JavaScript* & *React*. My interest in web development started at the beginning of 2020 when the pandemic emerged. I then completed a *MERN Stack* bootcamp with [Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilogy_Education_Services) - now [edX](https://www.edx.org/boot-camps/about) - in 2021.

In addition to my technical skills, over the course of my career I've accumulated graphic design, adaptive communication, client needs assessment, leadership, and creative problem solving savvy via my background as a teacher, artist, musician, social worker, and high-volume bartender.

**Currently**, I'm employed as a *web development instructor* at [Generation USA](https://www.generation.org/) where I've been teaching: 

>- git + GitHub
>- HTML 
>- CSS
>- JavaScript
>- Node 
>- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
>- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)

I've also recently been coordinating the development, editing, and implementation of a reusable curriculum for the JWD and JFS Programs, including the development of coding problems, projects, & solutions for program participants.

And with my own projects, I've been focused on building human-centered products, and beautiful, responsive web experiences for them.
