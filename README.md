Hi! Iâ€™m Kathryn - a full-stack web developer with technical skills in JavaScript & React and an affinity for front-end design. Currently engaged in a part-time teaching assistant role at Generation USA, as well as contract work creating homepages, branded content and product photos for professionals & small businesses.

Experience accumulated in communication, leadership, client needs, and visual+audio content creation is attributed to a dynamic and unconventional history as a musician, art student, social worker, and high-volume bartender. Recent global events sparked a need for change, which then lead to my application, acceptance, and awarded scholarship to Ohio State Universityâ€™s Full-stack Web Development Bootcamp and my pursuit to become a web developer. 

Vivid imagination and idealism motivate my initiative to solve root problems by building + implementing constructive solutions, while prioritizing elegant design and an intuitive user experience.
